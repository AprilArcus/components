# @looker/components

This package provides a series of components that implement Looker's Design System.

- **yarn workspace @looker/components develop** builds the component library with a `--watch` flag. Useful when actively developing a component and you wish to see the changes appear in either the [style guide](./packages/www) or [react playground](./packages/playground)
